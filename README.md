# Turtle Code 
## Picture of Original Drawing

![alt text](images/OriginalDrawing.png) "Original Drawing")...

*This code's main purpose is to recreate the original drawing I made in class during a class activity. The program will draw a house with a lined roof, two windows with lines, and a door with a doorknob, a father with a top hat and bow tie, a mother with a bow, a daughter with a bow, a sun, and a mustang with a spiky mane and fluffy tail and color in all of the aforementioned objects drawn. This program was designed solely for the aforementioned purpose and not for others to use. I learned how to create quadrilaterals, semi-circles, circles, triangles, and lines using turtle, how to navigate across turtle's coordinate plane for its default canvas size, how to shorten the amount of code I need to draw two instances of the same object via functions and x and y coordinates as parameters, and how to fills in shapes and backgrounds in turtle.*
