*This code's main purpose is to recreate the original drawing I made in class during a class activity. The program will draw a house with a lined roof, two windows with lines, and a door with a doorknob, a father with a top hat and bow tie, a mother with a bow, a daughter with a bow, a sun, and a mustang with a spiky mane and fluffy tail. This program was designed solely for the aforementioned purpose and not for others to use. *
